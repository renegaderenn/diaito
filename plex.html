# Plex Quality Settings
Guide to help setup Plex streaming devices to use their full potential. For some reason the default settings has the quality turned way down and it's highly annoying.

The most important setting if you’re connecting to a remote Plex server is `Remote Quality`. In order to stream 1080p and 4K content you will have to ensure that the `Remote Quality` setting is set to `Original`. Please note that streaming 4K requires a very fast internet connection and a somewhat powerful device for playback. If you experience issues such as buffering or stuttering it is likely related to a slow connection. Reduce the quality settings in this event.

The 3 most important settings to look for are `Remote Quality`. `Local Quality`, and `Direct Play`.
